Collection of recipes for ['debos' tool](https://github.com/go-debos/debos).

* `rpi3` contains a recipe for building an image for `stretch`.
* `rpi3bplus` contains a recipe for building an image for `buster`. It has only
been tested using a  USB-serial cable to connect to the rpi3. And Ethernet should
work.
